FM demodulation PLL analysis memo
15-JAN-2021 Kenji Rikitake

* Still unable to find out how the PLL system constants were defined
* Replacing the first 2nd-order LPF with the following
  2nd-order Butterworth filter looked OK
  scipy.signal.butter(2, 30, 'lowpass', False, 'sos', 384000)
* Adding another 2nd-order LPF might or might NOT decrease the
  lock frequency error
* After the lock frequency measurement, the lock delay time can be
  shortened to 0.5 second while maintaining the stability
  (previously 0.667 second) when the lock bandwidth is 30Hz
