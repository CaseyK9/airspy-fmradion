LMS convergence condition: 0 < mu < (2 / (N * (A^2)))
                           
where 
* N: filter order
* A: maximum amplitude aka complex abs for the signal
* alpha: step size
* mu: alpha / N

Therefore: A < sqrt(2 / alpha) when alpha is given

For example, if alpha = 0.1, A < sqrt(20), so A < 4.47

More conservative condition of LMS convergence: 0 < mu < (1 / (3 * tr[R]))
where tr[R] represents the total average input signal power,
also tr[R] = N * (A^2) [1]

Therefore: 0 < mu < (1 / (3 * (N * (A^2))))
which is equivalent to: 0 < alpha < (1 / (3 * (A^2)))
so the more conservative estimation is: : A < sqrt((1/3) * (1/alpha))

For example, if alpha = 0.1, A < sqrt(10/3), so A < 1.82

We've tried to use a variable step size algorithm [2], but the experimentation
result didn't show improvement (i.e., lower level) of QMM output. We concluded
that the variable step size was redundant and not necessary for FM stereo
broadcast reception, since we don't need faster convergence speed than the
pseudo-NLMS algorithm with the nearly-optimal parameter setting descrived above.

Note on [2]: the relationship of mu(n) and e(n) in this paper is inaccurate, though the curvature pattern of the relationship is worth considering.

We evaluated the Complex Normalized LMS [3] (Complex NLMS) with measuring the
signal square norm processed in the multipath filter, which resulted in an
improved reception condition under weak signals (e.g., IF ~= -55dB). We
decided to implement NLMS for v0.9.0.
